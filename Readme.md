### SE/CS575 Web Service Sample Files

This repository has multiple copies of a service, each done in a slightly different architecture style, and in a different programming language.  

The idea is to discuss different implementations of a common set of web services. Not only does this get into polyglot differences, we will investigate the differences between sync- and async- services.  We will also look at a couple of different programming models - functional and annotation driven

I also recently  started (still a WIP) to add some GRPC examples to the mix.
